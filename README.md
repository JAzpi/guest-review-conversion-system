# QR My Stay — Guest Review Conversion System for Hospitality

## Context

Online Travel Agencies (OTAs) heavily depend on guest reviews to determine ranking, visibility, and booking conversion. However, many satisfied guests never leave reviews due to friction in the process.

This project explores how reducing friction between stay and review can increase guest review generation and improve OTA performance.

---

## The Problem

Low review conversion creates:

- Lower OTA ranking and visibility
- Reduced booking conversion
- Weak reputation signal
- Lost revenue potential

Even small improvements in review generation can produce compounding visibility and revenue effects.

## The Solution

QR My Stay is a system designed to simplify the path from stay to review.

The approach:

1. Generate a personalized QR per reservation
2. Allow guests to scan during or after their stay
3. Redirect directly to their booking / review page
4. Reduce friction → Increase probability of review generation

## How It Works

Reservation → QR Generated → Guest Scan → Direct Review Access → Higher Review Conversion → Improved OTA Ranking

The system focuses on **timing, simplicity, and friction reduction** in the guest journey.
